      For years I have worked customer support roles, which gave me a lot regarding
      comunications skills and how to work in a team. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been always interested in programming. Just a few mounths ago I have decided 
      it is time to achive this goal. I have done Bootcamp which is around 5 months. 
      It gave me basic knowlage of the most popular languages and technologies. 
      And this is only the beggining of the journy.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a person who likes challenges and is well organized. I am committed to learning 
      and self-development so that I can consistently achieve better results. Currently 
      I am taking courses to get better in JS, React and other technologies.
